# A remainder accept term

## Purpose

After all those nice filters of what you don't want .. you may also want to accept some prefixes.

If you create a community in your ingress accept policy, you can always see where a specific prefix originated from.
You should do this as a good practice for all your bgp-import-policies. Customers, transits and IXP peerings.

If you tag all customer prefixes with BGP communities, it will also allow you to use those same communities in export policies towards your transits and bgp peers.

The local preference line is to give peering prefixes a better priority towards transit learned prefixes.

Target import policy : any bgp import policy

# Configuration Examples

## Junos

```
policy-options {
  policy-statement bgp-import-policy {

...
...

  term remainder {
      then {
          local-preference add 15;
          community add ixp-import;
          accept;
      }
   }
 }

community ixp-import members <your ASN>:<peer ASN>;
```

## IOS-XR

```
route-policy BGP_FILTER_IN
  ...
    ...
  endif
  set community ixp-import
  set local-preference +15
  done
end-policy
```

## OpenBGPD

```
neighbor $Peer {
...
        set community <your ASN>:<peer ASN>
}

match from any community <your ASN>:<peer ASN> set localpref +15
```

## FRR (vtysh)
```
neighbor <remote_IP> remote-as <remote_ASN>
neighbor <remote_IP> sender-as-path-loop-detection
address-family <IP_version> unicast
  neighbor <remote_IP> prefix-list BOGONS_v4 in
  neighbor <remote_IP> remove-private-AS
  neighbor <remote_IP> soft-reconfiguration inbound
  neighbor <remote_IP> activate
```

### RouterOS v7
These should be the last rules in the chain, by default RouterOS will add the new rules to the end of the list. 

```
/routing/filter/rule
add chain="GENERIC_PREFIX_LIST" rule="set bgp-local-pref 115;"
add chain="GENERIC_PREFIX_LIST" rule="append bgp-communities <your ASN>:<peer ASN>;"
add chain="GENERIC_PREFIX_LIST" rule="accept"
```
